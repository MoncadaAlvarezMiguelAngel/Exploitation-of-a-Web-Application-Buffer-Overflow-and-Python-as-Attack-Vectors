# Exploitation of a Web Application: Buffer Overflow and Python as Attack Vectors

## Objective

The aim of this complement is to continue working on the topic proposed in the TFG. To do
so, buffer overflow and Python are used as attack vectors to penetrate a web application. In
this manner, the aim is to test the potential of this vulnerability despite its ease of exploitation.
Therefore, with the creation of this complement it is possible to identify and exploit this type
of vulnerability in a web application within a controlled environment, thus providing a valuable
educational resource for the cybersecurity community and programmers interested in increasing
the security of web applications.
